# PowerShellLab #

These files are used for configuration with the [Autolab](https://github.com/theJasonHelmick/PS-AutoLab-Env) project. The intent is to setup a small domain environment for testing and teaching PowerShell. 

## Instructions
To use the scripts and configurations, download the [current release ](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/PowerShellLab/archive/0.9.zip). Extract the contents of the zip file folder to your Autolab Configurations directory. You should end up with something like C:\Autolab\Configurations\PowerShellLab which contains the files from this repository. Change to that directory and continue with the Autolab setup instructions.
